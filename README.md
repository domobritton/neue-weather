## Overview

Weather in California may be boring, but your weather app doesn't have to be. **Neue Weather** is a beautiful weather application that elevates the user experience to art. 

This application is inspired by mobile apps such as Dark Sky and Weathertron, and aims to bring a very clean and modern interface to the desktop experience--utilizing the latest best practices in Vanilla Javascript(ES6), CSS3, and HTML5.

## Functionality

* Landing page includes todays weather conditions. Users can interact with the page by mousing over the screen to view data at different times through the day
* KeyLeft/KeyRight to view the 7-day forecast and instructional slides
* KeyDown to reveal the current time, humidity, dewpoint
* Background colors will also shift from blues/light to dark theme as the user navigates from day to night forecasts
* Forecast, and current temperature will update in real-time without the need for browser refresh
